Things I refactored:

STRUCTURE CHANGES
- Moved ApolloProvider and Provider elements out of src/App.js and into src/index.js. I did this because it makes the App.js file easier to read and it's considered best practice.
- Removed the header tags and all it's child elements in the public/index.js file, then I created a Header component inside of the /src/views. 
- Removed the public/css/main.css file, and add the css to App.css, which I connected to App.js

CLASSNAME CHANGES
- Removed the divs with the className '_3im4pDXrDfzNRT2AlvLfD6' and '_3Ts2_4uirKsrlm2Qb57Avw' because they were not doing anything
- Removed '_3ORDzmMDnpzTXIIXjJsRw7' as a className and added it's one property into 'Ok22VaqPDW9x1uaR46cRO', which name I changed to 'priceoverlay' so it's more descriptive.
- Changed '_17Hci6D5EewOTY42eIXhPy' to 'price-overlay-monat' so it's more descriptive.
- Consolidated the span with the text '/' and the span with the text 'monat', and changed their className to 'price-overlay-monat-text' from '_2GcdOjvYR400SpIsNOxzGK' to be more descriptive
- Removed the div containing '3-hUUH6d0vGND3vUzaybD0 Lsdn2hC-tehVod76x4HzK' because it was redundant
- Removed '_1NES5HH5UNUjUVK5_-d-AG' from the code and added it to the 
- Changed '_17om8IEGFeu2W2TBOJ6xQs' to 'apt-size-text'
- Changed 'f9YmKwMaSOdtYnk_Qz-iT' to 'amenities-container'
